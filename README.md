Predict Sales Revenue:
This project focuses on predicting sales revenue based on temperature using machine learning techniques. It utilizes TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries to build and train regression models for revenue prediction.

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
TensorFlow
Pandas
Seaborn
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

You can install TensorFlow and other required libraries using pip:
pip install tensorflow pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Project Overview:
The project includes the following steps:
1. Import the sales dataset and perform data visualization.
2. Create training and testing datasets.
3. Build and train a regression model using TensorFlow.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
5. Visualize the regression results.
Optional: Confirm the model using a regression kit in Scikit-learn.

Contributing:
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
